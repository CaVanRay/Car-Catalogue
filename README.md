# Car-Catalogue
Moving car list program to its own repository so I can work on using git to push commits from my local machine


This is a simple car catalogue program that allows users to view a list of cars, add new cars, and search for cars by various attributes.

Right now I'm only writing it in a single file but eventually I plan on moving onto a multi-file structure and possibly adding a database backend.

Need to add:
  Find,  Print,  Add,  Remove,  Edit,  Save.
